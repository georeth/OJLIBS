1. global array, member array, std::vector has nearly the same performance
    std::accumulate(begin(arr), end(arr), 0);

    global_array: 10.78Gitem/s
    member_array: 10.39Gitem/s
    vector:       10.17Gitem/s

    only ~5% performance difference, and it can be noise.

2. code alignment can introduce 30% overhead!

    exactly the same code above.
    some code alignment for global_array only has 7.467Gitems/s.
    and we cannot control or predict it from C/C++.

    this may explain why some top performance submission has little difference from others.

    code alignment is a noise, but it makes so big difference.
